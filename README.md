# dj-MC : A Reinforcement-Learning Agent for Music Playlist Recommendation

In this project we implemented a reinforcement-Learning based algorithm that offers a sequence of songs to a user by learing from feedback and maximizing reward.

Data source (million Song Dataset):
http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset/

Instructions:
1. clone the repository.
2. run main_dj.py

NOTE: this repository contains the preproccesed data that is relevant for executing the program. However, If you have access to MSD, you can add more songs to the processed dataset by running preprocess.py with the raw data directory as the input.
